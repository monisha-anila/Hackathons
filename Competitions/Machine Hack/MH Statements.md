# [`Price Prediction`](https://github.com/monisha-anila/Tuning-Learning-rate/blob/main/Competitions/Machine%20Hack/Price%20Prediction.zip)
-  In this competition, we are challenging the MachineHack community to come up with an algorithm to predict the price of retail items belonging to different categories.
-  Foretelling the Retail price can be a daunting task due to the huge datasets with a variety of attributes ranging from Text, Numbers(floats, integers), and DateTime. Also, outliers can be a big problem when dealing with unit prices.

# Online Time Spent Prediction
- Buyers spend a significant amount of time surfing an e-commerce store, since the pandemic the e-commerce has seen a boom in the number of users across the domains. In the meantime, the store owners are also planning to attract customers using various algorithms to leverage customer behavior patterns
- Tracking customer activity is also a great way of understanding customer behavior and figuring out what can actually be done to serve them better. Machine learning and AI has already played a significant role in designing various recommendation engines to lure customers by predicting their buying patterns
- In this competition provided the visitor's session data, we are challenging the Machinehack community to come up with a regression algorithm to predict the time a buyer will spend on the platform.
