## Problem Statement 
- What opportunities exists for client’s car company after seeing revenue increase by  20% 2003(Q2) – 2005(Q2) to bring revenue gains by 50% at the end of 2006(Q2) through new product and delivery strategy or closing stores at low revenue?

## Success critiera 
- Implementing an effective product and delivery strategy to bring revenue gains by 50% by the end of 2006. 


## Scope of solution 
- Identify `car sales data that correlate` the `sales`
- Formation of `linear equation` for <b>sales</b> can be used for other stores?
- Statistics- [`Python`](https://github.com/monisha-anila/Hackathons/blob/main/Chargebacks.ipynb), [`Tableau`](https://public.tableau.com/profile/monisha.anila#!/vizhome/Sampledataoncarsales/CarSales)


## Constraints in solution 
- Expertise to `handle missing data` and <b>feature modelling</b> in `sales` and `domain expertise`.


## Stake holders
1. <b>Investors</b>
2. <b>CEO</b>
