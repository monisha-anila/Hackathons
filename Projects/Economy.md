# Economy Importance


## Problem Statement
- How the importance of Economy has changed over time by counting the number of times "Economy" appeared in PM's speeches? 
- We plan to look at the past 50 speeches.


## Solution 
- Using PM of India website [`URL link`](https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/)
- Find the text speeches which has economy as a key word for past 50 speeches.
- Manually searching the target will be cumbersome process. So, using Beautiful Soup package for web scraping which extracts target word count for a given website link. 


## Programming and documentation
- [`Python`](https://github.com/monisha-anila/Tuning-Learning-rate/blob/main/Projects/Economy.ipynb)
- [`PDF`](https://github.com/monisha-anila/Tuning-Learning-rate/blob/main/Projects/Economy.pdf)

## Challenges 
- The web scrapping process has lot of restrictions and needs to manual extract date from website.
